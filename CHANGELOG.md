# Changelog

## Unreleased (0.3.0)

### Breaking

- `store.kind = "postgres"` and `"pg"` now select `StoreKind::Postgres`, not
  CockroachDB. `"cockroach"` and `"crdb"` remain Cockroach. A leftover
  `kind = "postgres"` pointed at a Cockroach cluster fails at provision
  (`CREATE EXTENSION vector`) or first vector query (`<=>`) rather than
  silently ranking with Cockroach SQL.

### Added

- `StoreKind::Postgres` and Cargo feature `store-postgres` (same sqlx postgres
  driver as `store-cockroach`; no second driver). B2 lands templated-width
  pgvector DDL with an hnsw index from init. Dimensions above 2000 are
  refused at init, naming the pgvector hnsw ceiling and the unimplemented
  `halfvec` hatch. `lambo provision` for `kind = "postgres"` runs
  `init_schema` (not `scripts/provision.sh`).
- DSN identity normalisation beside `store_identity`: two spellings of one
  database (`postgres://u@host/db` and `postgres://u@host:5432/db`) derive one
  session endpoint. Password is stripped from the identity so it never reaches
  the filesystem or the lease row.
- `store_is_shareable(Postgres) = true`: a networked store another process can
  open, ruled in the exhaustive match, not defaulted.
- Postgres ranking: pgvector `<=>` (cosine distance) converts with `1 - d`.
  Cockroach stays `<->` L2 and `1 - d^2/2`. Copying either formula onto the
  other dialect is pinned to fail.

- Cargo feature `embed-gemini`: Vertex `gemini-embedding-001` embeddings, with a
  dim guard for the 768 / 1536 / 3072 the model truncates to.
- `src/gcp_auth.rs`: one Google OAuth path for every adapter that authenticates
  as a Google principal, gated `embed-gemini` OR `store-postgres`. Handles both
  credential kinds (service-account key by `jwt-bearer`, authorized-user ADC by
  `refresh_token`) and mints for the caller's own scope, so a Cloud SQL login and
  a Vertex call share an identity without sharing authority.
- Cloud SQL IAM database authentication for `store-postgres`, opted into with
  `LAMBO_POSTGRES_IAM`: the connection password is an OAuth token minted from the
  shared credential file, and the pool is rebuilt when that token expires. The
  opt-in is PostgreSQL only (`Dialect::SUPPORTS_CLOUD_SQL_IAM_AUTH`), so a build
  carrying both adapters never hands a Cloud SQL token to a Cockroach cluster.
- `scripts/cloudsql-allowlist.sh`: add the running host's egress IP to a Cloud SQL
  instance's authorized networks, idempotently, preserving entries it did not add.
- Released binaries (`ship`) now carry `store-postgres` and `embed-gemini`, so a
  `lambo.toml` naming `postgres` or `gemini` runs on a prebuilt binary.

### Notes

- B0's extraction already made `crate::store::pg::{PgStore, Dialect}` and
  `crate::store::pg::cockroach::CockroachDialect` public crate API. 0.3.0 is
  the first release that carries them.
